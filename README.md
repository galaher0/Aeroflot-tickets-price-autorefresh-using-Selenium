This is my first simple automation script in Python just to test my skills and help my friend.

Somehow I could not make flight aggregators tell me if a price on specific tickets changed, so I chose Selenium webdriver to automate browser refreshing and price checking.

At that time I did not know much about web, so the script required me to manually search tickets on start and then scipt started refreshing the page and if the price changed it would have made a sound signal and sent an email to my friends' @.
